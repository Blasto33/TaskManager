# What is Task Manager
Task Manager is a Discord bot made by Blasto, in order to annoy his friends and therefore, enjoy his life to the fullest.
It is currently able to run simple (and often **useless**) commands, play music and in the future, maybe more advanced commands?

# How can I add the bot to my server?
Just follow this link => https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=647034140864282654&scope=bot

# What are the commands available?

At this point, the bot does not have a lot of functionalities but I plan to improve it!

## Basic commands

## Music
- *!play* : Makes the bot join your current voice channel to play a nice song.
- *!leave* : Makes the bot leave the current voice channel. Good bye friend!
